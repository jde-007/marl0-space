## Opportunities to Deepen Research

### Data Gaps Identified

1. **Beach Inventory:** Only 1 beach catalogued in OSM. Need comprehensive mapping of:
   - Ocean Beach Park (New London)
   - DuBois Beach (Stonington)
   - Rocky Neck State Park (East Lyme)
   - Bluff Point beaches

2. **Restaurant Coverage:** Downtown Mystic has ~40+ restaurants; our current data captures few. Priority captures:
   - Fine dining venues
   - Waterfront casual
   - Family-friendly spots
   - Ethnic cuisine options

3. **Seasonal Events:** No event calendar data. Should capture:
   - Mystic Outdoor Art Festival (August)
   - Wooden Boat Show (August)
   - Sea Music Festival (June)
   - Lighted Boat Parade (December)

4. **Winery/Brewery Trail:** Connecticut's wine and craft beer scene is underrepresented. Map:
   - Stonington Vineyards
   - Jonathan Edwards Winery
   - Cottrell Brewing Company

### Enrichment Strategies

| Strategy | Expected Yield |
|----------|----------------|
| Google Places deep crawl for Mystic downtown | +50-80 venues |
| Yelp cross-reference for ratings | Quality signals |
| TripAdvisor attraction scrape | Visitor rankings |
| Local event calendar integration | Seasonal programming |
| Marina & boat charter listings | Water activity options |

### Research Questions for Phase 2

1. What's the seasonal occupancy pattern for vacation rentals? (Summer peak vs. fall leaf-peeper season)
2. What percentage of visitors are day-trippers vs. overnighters?
3. What's the average length of stay for different traveler segments?
4. How do casino visitors overlap with cultural tourists?

## Competitive Intelligence

**Strengths:**
- Unique maritime heritage (no comparable seaport museum on East Coast)
- Dual-casino proximity rare for New England
- Easy access from two major metros
- Year-round appeal (summer beaches, fall foliage, winter coziness)

**Weaknesses:**

**Market Position:**
Eastern CT occupies a sweet spot: more accessible than Cape Cod, more authentic than generic beach towns, and uniquely positioned for guests who want culture + coast + casino options in one trip.
