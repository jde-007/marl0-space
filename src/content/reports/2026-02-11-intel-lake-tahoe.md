## Opportunities to Deepen Research

### Data Gaps Identified

1. **Beach/Swimming Access:** Critical gap—dozens of public beaches not mapped:
   - Sand Harbor State Park
   - Kings Beach State Recreation Area
   - Pope Beach, Baldwin Beach, Kiva Beach
   - Hidden Beach, Skunk Harbor
   - Zephyr Cove

2. **Ski Resorts:** No resort data in system:
   - Palisades Tahoe, Heavenly, Northstar
   - Kirkwood, Sugar Bowl, Diamond Peak
   - Mt. Rose, Homewood, Sierra-at-Tahoe

3. **Marina/Boat Rentals:** Water access is core to the experience:
   - Lakeside Marina, Tahoe Keys Marina
   - Boat/kayak/paddleboard rental operators

4. **Trailheads:** Hiking is huge—need comprehensive trail access points

5. **Town Centers:** Multiple distinct communities:
   - South Lake Tahoe (CA)
   - Stateline (NV) — casinos
   - Tahoe City
   - Incline Village
   - Truckee
   - Kings Beach

### Enrichment Strategies

| Strategy | Expected Yield |
|----------|----------------|
| Ski resort API integration | Complete resort data |
| Google Places by town | +200-400 venues |
| Marina operator survey | Water rental options |
| Trail database integration | Hiking infrastructure |
| Seasonal event calendar | Festivals, races, concerts |

### Research Questions for Phase 2

1. What's the seasonal booking pattern shift (ski vs. summer)?
2. How do California-side vs. Nevada-side rentals differ in demand?
3. What's the average length of stay for ski trips vs. summer trips?
4. How do weekday vs. weekend patterns differ (Bay Area day-trippers)?
