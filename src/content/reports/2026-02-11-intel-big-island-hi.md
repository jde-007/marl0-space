## Opportunities to Deepen Research

   - Kahalu'u Beach Park
   - Magic Sands (Disappearing Beach)

2. **Activity Operators:** No tour operators captured:
   - Manta ray dive operators
   - Helicopter tours
   - Coffee farm tours
   - Stargazing tours
   - Luau venues

3. **Regional Towns:** Need detailed venue data for:
   - Kailua-Kona (main tourist hub)
   - Hilo (east side hub)
   - Waikoloa (resort area)
   - Volcano Village
   - Captain Cook
   - Waimea/Kamuela (ranch country)

4. **Dining Coverage:** Island has exceptional farm-to-table scene:
   - Merriman's (Big Island original)
   - Brown's Beach House
   - Roy's Waikoloa
   - Local plate lunch spots

### Enrichment Strategies

| Strategy | Expected Yield |
|----------|----------------|

| Yelp Hawaii deep dive | Quality/rating data |
| Activity operator aggregation | +50-100 tours |
| Farmers market mapping | Fresh/local experiences |
| Beach condition/safety data | Swim suitability info |

### Research Questions for Phase 2

1. Which side of island (Kona vs. Hilo) has higher vacation rental demand?
2. What's the optimal property positioning for volcano viewers vs. beach seekers?
3. How do seasonal patterns differ from other Hawaiian islands?
4. What's the impact of volcanic activity on booking patterns?

## Competitive Intelligence

**Strengths:**
- Only place in US to see active lava (potentially)
- Most diverse landscapes of any Hawaiian island
- Lower crowds than Maui/Oahu
- Better value vacation rentals
- Authentic Hawaiian culture preserved

**Weaknesses:**
- Larger driving distances required
- Some beaches less accessible
- Fewer direct mainland flights than Honolulu
- Vog (volcanic smog) can affect air quality

**Market Position:**
Big Island is the "explorer's Hawaii" — best for travelers who want adventure, nature, and authenticity over resort convenience. It complements rather than competes with Maui (luxury beaches) and Oahu (urban/tourist infrastructure).
