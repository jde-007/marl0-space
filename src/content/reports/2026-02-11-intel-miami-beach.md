## Market Overview

**Primary Destination:** Miami Beach, Florida  
**Region:** Miami-Dade County, barrier island  
**Distinct Areas:** South Beach (SoBe), Mid-Beach, North Beach, Bal Harbour  
**Best Seasons:** Winter/Spring (escape cold), avoid hurricane season

Miami Beach is America's most glamorous beach destination—Art Deco architecture, international cuisine, legendary nightlife, and a cultural energy that makes it feel more like a global city than a beach town. South Beach is the epicenter, but Mid-Beach and North Beach offer quieter alternatives.
