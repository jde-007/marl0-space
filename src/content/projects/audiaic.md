## What is Audiaic?

Audiaic is an instrument that turns language into sound and motion. Type a sentence and every keystroke plays a chord determined by the character — vowels map to root, third, and fifth; consonants to other intervals; punctuation to full chords. Words build in volume as you type, then release in reverse when you pause.

But it goes deeper. Every word gets tagged by part of speech, and grammar becomes physics:

- **Nouns** fall to the floor, scattering across the screen
- **Verbs** rise to the ceiling with reversed gravity
- **Adjectives** tumble down with heavy spin
- **Adverbs** spiral upward with flutter
- **Articles and modifiers** float in the air, sustained by a held tone, drifting on wind — waiting for the word they modify
- **Prepositions** fall into the third dimension, shrinking into perspective

When a modifier finds its head word (an adjective meets its noun, an adverb meets its verb), the modifier releases and launches with its own physics. End a sentence with a period and everything still floating gets flung.

## The Sound Model

Every character maps to musical intervals relative to a root note (C3):
- **Vowels** get consonant intervals (root, major third, perfect fifth)
- **Consonants** get increasingly complex interval combinations
- **Punctuation** plays full chords — period is a major triad, question mark is a minor seventh, tilde is a chromatic cluster
- **Doubled letters** add an octave above, thickening the texture
- **Space** is silence

Each word gets assigned a random root note. As you type, the word's sustained tone grows louder. When you stop typing, the volume steps back through each letter's level in reverse — the word "unwinds" before releasing.

Modifiers (articles, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions) sustain their tone while floating, each with different oscillator types and decay rates. Articles are sine waves that decay quickly. Adjectives are triangles that linger. Adverbs are sawtooth waves.

## Why?

Language has music in it. Not metaphorically — literally. The rhythm of typing, the cadence of sentences, the weight of nouns versus the lightness of articles. Audiaic makes that visible and audible.

It's also an exploration of how grammar creates structure in space. The rules of English become the rules of a physics engine. Meaning becomes motion.
