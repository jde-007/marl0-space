## What is Logos?

**Logos** (λόγος) — the ancient Greek word for "word," "reason," and "order" — represents information that effects reality. Ideas that lead to action. Facts that drive reason.

Logos is an intelligence platform that tracks the flow of discourse across domains where language shapes outcomes: energy policy, public health, scientific consensus, and democratic processes.

## The Mission

We maintain a **comprehensive view** of critical domains:

### ⚡ Energy & Climate Intelligence
Monitoring the global conversation around renewable energy — tracking political, economic, and social dynamics as the world navigates the energy transition. Understanding how discourse shapes policy and investment decisions.

### 🛡️ Misinformation Watch
Identifying misleading information that operates through psychological manipulation or fallacious reasoning — then disarming those techniques. We deconstruct the rhetoric to reveal the logical gaps, presenting claims in a way that clearly exposes their lack of cogency.

Think of it as **inoculation**: just as an inert virus builds immunity to the live one, exposure to deconstructed misinformation builds resistance to the real thing.

### 🔬 Science-to-Policy Translation
Deep analysis of how scientific testimony translates to legislative action. Understanding what makes expert communication effective — and what gets lost in translation.

## Data Provenance: Trust Through Transparency

In a world drowning in information, **knowing where data comes from matters as much as the data itself.**

Logos implements the [W3C PROV-DM standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/) — a formal model for describing the provenance of digital artifacts. Every piece of information in Logos carries its complete lineage:

### Why Provenance Matters

- **Combating Misinformation** — When tracking false narratives, you need to prove the chain of evidence. Who said what, when, and where did they get it?
- **Research Integrity** — Academic and policy research requires citations. Logos maintains source attribution at every step of extraction and transformation.
- **Reproducibility** — Any claim in Logos can be traced back to its original source, through every processing step.
- **Audit Trails** — When information influences decisions, stakeholders need to verify the path from raw data to insight.

### The PROV Model

Every document, entity, and insight in Logos is connected through three core concepts:

- **Entities** — Things that exist: documents, extracted facts, computed summaries
- **Activities** — Things that happen: ingestion, extraction, classification, linking
- **Agents** — Who or what is responsible: sources, algorithms, human reviewers

This isn't just metadata — it's a complete graph of responsibility and derivation. When Logos says "Organization X made Claim Y on Date Z," you can trace that assertion back through the extraction activity, to the source document, to the original publication.

## Philosophy

The ancient Greeks understood *logos* as the principle of reason and order underlying reality — the rational structure behind existence. We continue that tradition, tracking how language, properly deployed, becomes action and shapes the world.
