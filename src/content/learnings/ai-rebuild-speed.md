RollDeep v1: one year, ~$80k in contractors. RollDeep v2: two months, solo, using AI coding agents. The output was better.

The lesson isn't "AI makes you faster." It's that the bottleneck shifts. When code generation is cheap, the constraint becomes taste, architecture, and domain knowledge — things that take years to develop and can't be automated. The people who benefit most from AI coding tools aren't juniors who need help writing code. It's seniors who know exactly what they want and can now get it built at the speed of thought.
