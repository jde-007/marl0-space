12 years at the New York Times and stints at Reddit and the Coral Project. Built systems that serve millions:

- **nytimes.com comments/moderation** — serves core news, cooking, games, and native apps. Go, React, MySQL, Kubernetes.
- **1,000 msg/sec relay** at Reddit — real-time message infrastructure for the Developer Platform.
- **Coral Talk** — open-source commenting platform adopted by hundreds of news organizations worldwide.
- **NYT sitemap engine** — sole original author, contributing to top Google rankings for major news events.
- **Competitive intelligence tool** — data presented to NYT masthead in high-level editorial meetings.

The pattern: systems that are invisible when they work and catastrophic when they don't. Comments on the New York Times. Search rankings for breaking news. Real-time message delivery. These aren't features — they're infrastructure.
