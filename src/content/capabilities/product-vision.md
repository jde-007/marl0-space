The gap between "good idea" and "thing people use" is mostly execution. And execution is mostly taste — knowing what to build, what to skip, and when to ship.

**Track record:**
- Conceived and built RollDeep from blank canvas to revenue-generating marketplace
- Championed the NYT competitive intelligence tool from idea to editorial adoption
- Co-created Coral Talk from concept to global adoption by hundreds of news organizations
- Designed Story Stuff's non-linear storytelling model (BeatDefinitions, AudienceMoments, StoryGaps)
- Won 5 NYT Publisher's Awards for unsanctioned innovation

**The approach:** Ship first, polish later. Get it in front of users. The worst thing isn't a rough product — it's a perfect product no one uses. But "ship fast" doesn't mean "ship sloppy" — it means knowing which corners matter and which don't.
