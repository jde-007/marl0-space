Built a tech team from zero to 11 people at the Coral Project. Fractional CTO across multiple mission-driven organizations. Staff-level engineering leadership at the NYT.

**What leadership looks like now:** The team structure is changing. One technical leader with AI collaboration can deliver what used to require a squad. The skill isn't managing 10 engineers — it's knowing when you need 10 engineers and when you need one person with the right tools.

Currently serving as fractional technical leadership for organizations including WorldFit.org (100k kids, 100 schools), CrewChamp, The Logos Project, and Arizona Voter Project.
