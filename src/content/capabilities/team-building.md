- Built the Coral Project tech team from zero to 11 engineers
- Staff-level engineering leadership at The New York Times
- Fractional CTO across 4 mission-driven organizations:
- **WorldFit.org** — served 100k kids in 100 schools
- **CrewChamp** — team coordination platform
- **The Logos Project** & **Arizona Voter Project** — civic engagement technology
- The team structure is changing
- One technical leader with AI collaboration can deliver what used to require a squad
- The skill isn't managing 10 engineers
- It's knowing when you need 10 engineers and when you need one person with the right tools
