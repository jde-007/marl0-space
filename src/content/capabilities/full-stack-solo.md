- Not prototypes or demos — production systems handling real money and real users
- RollDeep v1 took a year and ~$80k with contractors
- V2 was rebuilt in two months, solo, using AI coding agents
- The output was better
- That's not a productivity hack — it's a fundamentally different way of building software
- One person can now do what used to require a team of 5-10
- Not because the work got easier, but because the bottleneck shifted from typing to thinking
- The constraint is now taste, judgment, and architecture — not labor
