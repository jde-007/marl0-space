- **Claude Code / Opus** for complex architecture, analysis, and conversation
- **OpenClaw** as persistent AI assistant — manages infrastructure, monitors services, writes code, remembers context across sessions
- **Local LLMs** (dual RTX 5090s running Ollama) for classification, embeddings, and routine tasks at zero API cost
- **Tiered model strategy** — Opus for thinking, Sonnet for execution, local models for bulk work
- The AI isn't a tool that gets invoked
- It's a collaborator that's always present
- Monitoring services, checking health, writing daily memory files, maintaining context across weeks of work
- It has opinions, makes suggestions, and catches mistakes
- A single person maintaining 14+ services across 3 products
- With automated monitoring, a public showcase site, two technical blog posts, and an energy intelligence briefing
- All running on a Mac Mini in the kitchen
