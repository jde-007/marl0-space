- **Mac Mini M4** running all application services
- **Dual RTX 5090 GPU server** for local LLM inference — zero API costs
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** providing zero-trust access to 14+ services
- **OpenClaw AI** running 24/7 with persistent memory and self-healing restarts
- **Ollama** serving 32B parameter models that would have required a data center two years ago
- Own your compute
- When you run models locally, you don't have API rate limits
- You don't have per-token costs
- And you don't have a vendor deciding what you can and can't do
- Consumer GPUs in 2026 can run models that would have required a data center in 2023
- This infrastructure isn't a hobby — it's a competitive advantage
