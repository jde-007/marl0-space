Built the tech team (which at one point reached 11 people) and led the development of [Talk](https://github.com/coralproject/talk) — an open-source commenting platform adopted by **hundreds of news organizations globally**.

**AI early adoption:** Early partner with Alphabet's Jigsaw as they built the [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/) for toxic comment detection. This was 2015 — years before the current AI wave.

The Coral Project was a collaboration between the NYT, The Washington Post, and Mozilla, funded by the Knight Foundation. Building open-source tools to improve online conversation at scale.
