Built and launched a vacation rental marketplace from zero. $2.5M+ in transactions across marketplaces and booking services. Ran the whole ship — product, engineering, operations, property management.

**The AI pivot:** Used AI coding agents to rebuild RollDeep v2 in **two months solo** — the initial version took a year and ~$80k with contractors. This isn't a talking point; it's a 6x speed improvement with better results.

**What's in it:**
- Market-wide data aggregation and classification system (Google Places → local LLM annotation → traveler-facing recommendations)
- Personalized traveler tooling with survey-driven experience matching
- Rich financial reporting
- Multiple LLM and RAG features from data ingestion through trip planning
- Intelligence pipeline running on local 32B parameter models with 93%+ accuracy

**Property operations:** Acquired, renovated, and managed The Kemble — the highest-grossing vacation rental on mainland Massachusetts.
